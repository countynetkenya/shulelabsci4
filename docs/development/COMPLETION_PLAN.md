# 🏁 ShuleLabs Module Completion Plan

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Goal:** Achieve 100% Module Completion via "Turbo CRUD v3" Protocol.

## 🧠 Strategy: "Divide & Conquer"

We will execute the remaining modules in **4 Phases**, moving from foundational operational modules to advanced platform features.

### Phase 1: Operational Core (The "Turbo" Batch)
*Focus: Physical assets and system scheduling. High priority for daily operations.*

1.  **Inventory** (Refactor)
    *   **Status:** Existing but complex. Needs standardization to v3.
    *   **Action:** Apply Turbo CRUD v3. Simplify Service layer.
2.  **Library**
    *   **Status:** Pending.
    *   **Action:** Full Turbo CRUD v3 implementation.
3.  **Scheduler**
    *   **Status:** Pending.
    *   **Action:** Full Turbo CRUD v3 implementation.

### Phase 2: Commerce & Finance Extensions
*Focus: Revenue generation and financial tracking.*

1.  **POS (Point of Sale)**
    *   **Dependency:** Requires `Inventory` (Phase 1).
    *   **Action:** Implement Sales interface, Cart logic, and Inventory deduction.
2.  **Wallets**
    *   **Status:** Review existing.
    *   **Action:** Ensure integration with POS and Finance.

### Phase 3: Engagement & Communication
*Focus: User interaction and gamification.*

1.  **Parent Engagement**
    *   **Features:** Surveys, Events, Messaging.
    *   **Action:** Turbo CRUD for Events/Surveys.
2.  **Gamification**
    *   **Features:** Points, Badges.
    *   **Action:** Service-heavy implementation.

### Phase 4: Platform Infrastructure
*Focus: Enterprise features and scalability.*

1.  **Approval Workflows** (Maker-Checker)
2.  **Monitoring** (Health Checks)
3.  **Analytics & AI**
4.  **Governance**
5.  **Multi-Tenant** (Provisioning)

## 🚀 Execution Order (Immediate)

We will proceed sequentially with **Phase 1**, then **Phase 2**.

1.  **Inventory** (Current Task)
2.  **Library**
3.  **Scheduler**
4.  **POS**

## 🛠️ Parallelism Opportunities

Once Phase 1 is complete:
- **Track A:** POS & Wallets (Commerce Team)
- **Track B:** Parent Engagement & Gamification (Frontend Team)
- **Track C:** Platform Modules (DevOps Team)

For now, as a single agent, we execute **Sequentially** to ensure quality and context retention.
